# React Weather Project

This project is a React SPA built to allow users to search for current and forecasted weather data in any city.

## Description

This app uses the SheCodes weather API to retrieve weather data and display the current temperature along with five forecasted temperatures of the city searched. The default display of the application shows the weather in Denver, Colorado.

## Instructions

In the search bar at the top of the app ('Enter a city'), users type the name of any city in the world and then select 'Search' or press enter. The current temperature of the city searched will then be displayed, along with five forecasted temperatures.
